# Pupil-size-as-a-somatic-marker-during-reinforcement-learning
This project is conducted within the Conscious Brain Lab at UvA, supervised by Simon van Gaal and Ivan Ivanchei. To examine if pupil functions as a somatic marker during a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, we fitted the behavioural responses to Q-learn models provided by Van Slooten, (2018). and correlated pupil with different parameters..
1. full_separate_alphas_model_45.py, updated_group_level_stan_45.py, updated_run_script_45.py are using stan model (hierarchical q_learn model adapted from van slooten) to gather q-values based on subjects’ behavioral responses during the task. 
2. files named ending with ‘_analysis.py’ are exploring the stimulus-related effects: non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests, linear-mixed effects modelling, within-subject median split analysis were used to examine the correlation between stimulus-related pupil responses and actual reward probability and q-values of the options. Provided files are for the first stimulus analysis and the experiment contains a second stimulus which was measured using similar methods.
